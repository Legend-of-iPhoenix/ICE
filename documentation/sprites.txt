1) Download the latest ConvPNG prerelease from here: https://github.com/MateoConLechuga/ConvPNG/releases/latest

2) Create a file called "convpng.ini" (Without the quotes, also mind the extension)

3) Copy and paste these lines into convpng.ini:


#GroupICE            : ice_gfx
#Palette             : xlibc
#PNGImages           :


4) Now, below the #PNGImages line you can simply add the names of the png files you wish to convert, as long as the png files are in the same directory as convpng. 
For example, if I have 3 pngs named xxxx, yyyy, and zzzz, this is what my convpng.ini file would look like:


#GroupICE            : ice_gfx
#Palette             : xlibc
#PNGImages           :
 xxxx
 yyyy
 zzzz


5) To run convpng, simply double click on the convpng.exe file. Output will be written to ice_gfx.txt

6) Copy the code from ice_gfx.txt to your program
